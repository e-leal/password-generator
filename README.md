The Password Generator will prompt a user to confirm if they would like particular criteria met, such as Capital letter, special character, or number, included in their randomly generated password. The Password generator will also prompt the user to answer how many characters they would like their randomly generated password to be. Once the user enters this information in, a randomized password matching this particular criteria will be generated for the user to utilize.
